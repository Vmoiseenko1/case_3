# Case-study â„–3
# Developers: Moiseenko V., Vlasov V.
# The aim: to write a program for performing two-color paving of the plane with regular hexagons

import turtle

# For Victoria:
def get_color_choice(): # to add colours, take two colours, at least 6 colours, reentry if wrong
    pass

# For Vlas:
def get_num_hexagons(N): # to check whether data entry is correct, 4 <= N <= 20
    pass

# For both:
def draw_hexagon(x, y):
    # For Victoria: to count the side of haxagon, to draw the hexagon + code review
    # For Vlas: to draw the line of hexagons
